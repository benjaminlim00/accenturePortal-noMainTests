# Accenture Ticket Requests Portal - fixed crash + removed main test

Project for SUTD term 5
Worked with accenture team to create a ticket requests handling web application.

To run web app:
cd into accenture-proto and run npm start

To run jest tests:
cd into accenture-proto and run npm test

NOTE: 
1. Main tests have been removed from this repo, please run npm install to install required dependencies before running the application for the first time, in main folder as well as backend folder.
2. SMS alert functionality is disabled as Twilo trial account has expired. Please replace with suitable replacement.
3. Also fixed crashing issue by following this guide - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53545800/internal-modules-cjs-loader-js582-throw-err
